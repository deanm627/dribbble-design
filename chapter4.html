        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <p>
            Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the
            cauldron with the water, and light the fire. We will bake first,
            said the old woman, I have already heated the oven, and kneaded
            the dough. She pushed poor Gretel out to the oven, from which
            flames of fire were already darting. Creep in, said the witch,
            and see if it properly heated, so that we can put the bread in.
            And once Gretel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let
            her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too. But Gretel saw
            what she had in mind, and said, I do not know how I am to do it.
            How do I get in. Silly goose, said the old woman, the door is big
            enough. Just look, I can get in myself, and she crept up and
            thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that
            drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the
            bolt. Oh. Then she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran
            away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death.
            Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little
            stable, and cried, Hansel, we are saved. The old witch is dead.
            Then Hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is
            opened. How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance
            about and kiss each other. And as they had no longer any need to
            fear her, they went into the witch's house, and in every corner
            there stood chests full of pearls and jewels. These are far better
            than pebbles. Said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever
            could be got in, and Gretel said, I, too, will take something home
            with me, and filled her pinafore full. But now we must be off, said
            Hansel, that we may get out of the witch's forest.
        </p>
        <p>
            When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great
            stretch of water. We cannot cross, said Hansel, I see no
            foot-plank, and no bridge. And there is also no ferry, answered
            Gretel, but a white duck is swimming there. If I ask her, she
            will help us over. Then she cried -
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>little duck, little duck, dost thou see,</p>
            <p>Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee.</p>
            <p>There's never a plank, or bridge in sight,</p>
            <p>take us across on thy back so white.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back,
            and told his sister to sit by him. No, replied Gretel, that will be
            too heavy for the little duck. She shall take us across, one after
            the other. The good little duck did so, and when they were once
            safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to
            be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from
            afar their father's house. Then they began to run, rushed into the
            parlor, and threw themselves round their father's neck. The man
            had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the
            forest. The woman, however, was dead. Gretel emptied her
            pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and
            Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to
            them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in
            perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever
            catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.
