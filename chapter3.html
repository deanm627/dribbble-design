        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <p>
            It was now three mornings since they had left their father's house.
            They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the
            forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and
            weariness.  When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white
            bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood
            still and listened to it.  And when its song was over, it spread its
            wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they
            reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted.  And when
            they approached the little house they saw that it was built of
            bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear
            sugar.  We will set to work on that, said Hansel, and have a good
            meal.  I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat some
            of the window, it will taste sweet.  Hansel reached up above, and
            broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel
            leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.  Then a soft
            voice cried from the parlor -
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>nibble, nibble, gnaw</p>
                <p>who is nibbling at my little house.</p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            The children answered -
        </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>the wind, the wind,</p>
                <p>the heaven-born wind,</p>
            </blockquote>
        <p>
            and went on eating without disturbing themselves.  Hansel, who
            liked the taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and
            Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and
            enjoyed herself with it.  Suddenly the door opened, and a woman
            as old as the hills, who supported herself on crutches, came
            creeping out.  Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that
            they let fall what they had in their hands. The old woman, however,
            nodded her head, and said, oh, you dear children, who has brought
            you here.  Do come in, and stay with me.  No harm shall happen to
            you.  She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little
            house.  Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes,
            with sugar, apples, and nuts.  Afterwards two pretty little beds
            were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
            in them, and thought they were in heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old woman had only pretended to be so kind.  She was in reality
            a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
            little house of bread in order to entice them there.  When a child
            fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that
            was a feast day with her.  Witches have red eyes, and cannot see
            far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when
            human beings draw near.  When Hansel and Gretel came into her
            neighborhood, she laughed with malice, and said mockingly, I have
            them, they shall not escape me again.  Early in the morning before
            the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both
            of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump and rosy
            cheeks, she muttered to herself, that will be a dainty mouthful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried
            him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a grated door.
            Scream as he might, it would not help him.  Then she went to
            Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, get up, lazy thing,
            fetch some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is
            in the stable outside, and is to be made fat.  When he is fat, I
            will eat him.  Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in
            vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.
            And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel
            got nothing but crab-shells.  Every morning the woman crept to the
            little stable, and cried, Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may
            feel if you will soon be fat.  Hansel, however, stretched out a
            little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not
            see it, and thought it was Hansel's finger, and was astonished that
            there was no way of fattening him.  When four weeks had gone by,
            and Hansel still remained thin, she was seized with impatience and
            would not wait any longer.  Now, then, Gretel, she cried to the
            girl, stir yourself, and bring some water.  Let Hansel be fat or
            lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.  Ah, how the poor
            little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how
            her tears did flow down her cheeks.  Dear God, do help us, she
            cried.  If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we
            should at any rate have died together.  Just keep your noise to
            yourself, said the old woman, it won't help you at all.
