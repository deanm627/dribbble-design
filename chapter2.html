            They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came
            once more to their father's house.  They knocked at the door, and
            when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel,
            she said, you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the
            forest.  We thought you were never coming back at all.  The father,
            however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them
            behind alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout
            the land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to
            their father, everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left,
            and that is the end.  The children must go, we will take them
            farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out
            again.  There is no other means of saving ourselves.  The man's
            heart was heavy, and he thought, it would be better for you to share
            the last mouthful with your children.  The woman, however, would
            listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached
            him.  He who says a must say b, likewise, and as he had yielded the
            first time, he had to do so a second time also.
        </p>

            The children, however, were still awake and had heard the
            conversation.  When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up,
            and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but
            the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out.
            Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, do not cry,
            Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.
            Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of
            their beds.  Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was
            still smaller than the time before.  On the way into the forest
            Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a
            morsel on the ground.  Hansel, why do you stop and look round.
            Said the father, go on.  I am looking back at my little pigeon
            which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,
            answered Hansel.  Fool.  Said the woman, that is not your little
            pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.
            Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path.
            The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they
            had never in their lives been before.  Then a great fire was again
            made, and the mother said, just sit there, you children, and when
            you are tired you may sleep a little.  We are going into the forest
            to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and
            fetch you away.  When it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of
            bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way.  Then they
            fell asleep and evening passed, but no one came to the poor
            children.  They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel
            comforted his little sister and said, just wait, Gretel, until the
            moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have
            strewn about, they will show us our way home again.  When the moon
            came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands
            of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all
            up.  Hansel said to Gretel, we shall soon find the way, but they did
            not find it.  They walked the whole night and all the next day too
            from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
            and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
            berries, which grew on the ground.  And as they were so weary that
            their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree
            and fell asleep.
