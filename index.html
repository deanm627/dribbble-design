                <p>Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife
                    and his two children. He had little to bite and to break, and once when
                    great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily

                    once more to their father's house.  They knocked at the door, and
                    when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel,
                    she said, you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the

                    They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the
                    forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and
                    weariness.  When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white
