                    <p>Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife
                    and his two children. He had little to bite and to break, and once when
                    great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily

                    once more to their father's house.  They knocked at the door, and

                    They began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the
                    forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and
